## Overview :writing_hand:

Todo app allows you to create task lists and save a backup of the data thanks to a REST API that connects to a MongoDB database. As a user, you can list, create, edit, and delete tasks and keep an eye on them.
The application connects to a backend API developed in Express with Typescript to handle data. This repository contains the frontend structure. Here is the link to the backend repository: [Backend Repository](https://github.com/Cristianjs93/todo-api), and the link to the deployed application on Vercel: [Deployed Project]()."
